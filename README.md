# Surround-iOS
I had to remove MobileVLCKit to get this to commit because vlckit was to big. To put it back go to http://nightlies.videolan.org/build/ios/ and download MobileVLCKit-UniversalBinary-20150312-0555.zip. Either copy project files to a new folder or mess with git ignore so you can put the large mobilevlckit framework into the project. Unpack the ZIP file and drag MobileVLCKit.framework to your project directory. Finally link the framework to your project by going to openning xcode, clicking on your project in xcode, going to build phases, expanding link binary with libraries and adding mobilevlckit.
